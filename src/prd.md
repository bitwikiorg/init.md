# Product Requirements Document: init.md - AI Agent Initialization Templates

## Core Purpose & Success
- **Mission Statement**: Provide structured initialization templates that help AI agents bootstrap themselves with essential project context and documentation generation capabilities.
- **Success Indicators**: Users can quickly select appropriate templates, understand implementation approaches, and successfully generate project documentation using their AI agents.
- **Experience Qualities**: Professional, efficient, educational

## Project Classification & Approach
- **Complexity Level**: Light Application (multiple features with basic state)
- **Primary User Activity**: Acting (copying templates, implementing protocols)

## Thought Process for Feature Selection
- **Core Problem Analysis**: AI agents need structured ways to initialize themselves and understand project contexts, but current approaches are ad-hoc and inconsistent.
- **User Context**: Developers and DevOps professionals working with AI agents in various environments from personal projects to production systems.
- **Critical Path**: Template selection → customization understanding → implementation → validation
- **Key Moments**: Template comparison, content copying, implementation guidance

## Essential Features

### Template Gallery with Navigation
- **What it does**: Displays three initialization templates (Minimal, Server, Dry-Run) with detailed descriptions and navigation controls
- **Why it matters**: Allows users to understand different approaches and select the most appropriate template for their needs
- **Success criteria**: Users can easily browse templates and understand their differences

### Template Content Display and Copying
- **What it does**: Shows full template content in readable format with one-click copying functionality
- **Why it matters**: Enables immediate implementation without manual transcription errors
- **Success criteria**: Content is readable on all devices and copying works reliably

### Implementation Guide
- **What it does**: Provides step-by-step guidance on how to define project scope, map systems, and customize templates
- **Why it matters**: Bridges the gap between template selection and successful implementation
- **Success criteria**: Users understand how to adapt templates to their specific environments

### Responsive Design
- **What it does**: Ensures optimal viewing and interaction across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Why it matters**: Users access documentation on various devices and need consistent experience
- **Success criteria**: All content is accessible and functional on screens from 320px to 1920px+ width

## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
- **Emotional Response**: Professional confidence with approachable clarity
- **Design Personality**: Technical precision meets modern simplicity - like high-quality developer tools
- **Visual Metaphors**: Clean code aesthetics, system architecture diagrams, terminal interfaces
- **Simplicity Spectrum**: Minimal interface that lets content shine, with purposeful visual hierarchy

### Color Strategy
- **Color Scheme Type**: Monochromatic with strategic accent
- **Primary Color**: Deep blue (oklch(0.3 0.15 240)) - conveys technical expertise and reliability
- **Secondary Colors**: Light blue-grays for cards and supporting elements
- **Accent Color**: Green (oklch(0.65 0.15 140)) - for success states and interactive elements
- **Color Psychology**: Blue establishes trust and technical competence, while green provides positive feedback
- **Color Accessibility**: All pairings meet WCAG AA contrast requirements (4.5:1 minimum)
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (white) + Foreground (near-black): 15.2:1 ratio
  - Primary (deep blue) + Primary-foreground (white): 8.7:1 ratio
  - Card (light blue-gray) + Card-foreground (near-black): 14.8:1 ratio

### Typography System
- **Font Pairing Strategy**: Inter for UI (clean, modern sans-serif) paired with Fira Code for code blocks (monospace clarity)
- **Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear scaling from 2xl headers down to xs helper text with consistent weight progression
- **Font Personality**: Inter conveys modern professionalism while Fira Code ensures code readability
- **Readability Focus**: 1.5x line height for body text, generous spacing between sections
- **Typography Consistency**: Semantic heading structure (h1-h4) with consistent color and weight application
- **Which fonts**: Inter (weights 400, 500, 600, 700) and Fira Code (weight 400) from Google Fonts
- **Legibility Check**: Both fonts tested for clarity at small sizes and on various backgrounds

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
- **Attention Direction**: Primary content in center column with secondary navigation elements on periphery
- **White Space Philosophy**: Generous padding and margins create breathing room and focus attention
- **Grid System**: Responsive grid using CSS Grid and Flexbox for complex layouts
- **Responsive Approach**: Mobile-first design that progressively enhances for larger screens
- **Content Density**: Balanced information density that avoids overwhelming while providing comprehensive details

### Animations
- **Purposeful Meaning**: Subtle hover states and transitions reinforce interactivity without distraction
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Button hovers, tab transitions, and template navigation use consistent timing
- **Contextual Appropriateness**: Minimal, functional animations that support rather than showcase

### UI Elements & Component Selection
- **Component Usage**: shadcn/ui components for consistency and accessibility (Cards, Tabs, Buttons, Badges)
- **Component Customization**: Tailwind utilities for spacing, colors, and responsive behavior
- **Component States**: Clear hover, active, and focus states for all interactive elements
- **Icon Selection**: Phosphor icons for consistent visual language (outlined style)
- **Component Hierarchy**: Primary actions (Copy buttons), secondary navigation (Template arrows), tertiary information (Badges)
- **Spacing System**: Consistent 4px grid system using Tailwind's spacing scale
- **Mobile Adaptation**: Stacked layouts for small screens, side-by-side for larger screens

### Visual Consistency Framework
- **Design System Approach**: Component-based design with consistent props and styling patterns
- **Style Guide Elements**: Color variables, typography scale, spacing system, component variants
- **Visual Rhythm**: Consistent card styling, button treatments, and spacing patterns
- **Brand Alignment**: Technical aesthetic that reinforces tool quality and reliability

### Accessibility & Readability
- **Contrast Goal**: WCAG AA compliance achieved across all text and meaningful non-text elements
- **Additional Considerations**: Keyboard navigation, semantic HTML structure, screen reader compatibility

## Edge Cases & Problem Scenarios
- **Potential Obstacles**: Users may not understand which template fits their specific use case
- **Edge Case Handling**: Clear template selection guide with specific use cases and examples
- **Technical Constraints**: Must work across various screen sizes and devices

## Implementation Considerations
- **Scalability Needs**: Template content may expand, interface should accommodate additional templates
- **Testing Focus**: Template copying functionality, responsive behavior, content readability
- **Critical Questions**: Are the templates comprehensive enough? Is the guidance actionable?

## Reflection
This approach uniquely combines technical precision with educational clarity, making complex initialization concepts accessible while maintaining professional standards. The focus on practical implementation bridges the gap between template selection and successful deployment.
